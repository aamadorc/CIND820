# Background

The pandemic of the COVID-19 extended from China across the world. It not only shutdown the world as we knew it but also challenged the scientific community to find a vaccine to control the virus. In a record time, laboratories around the world rushed to find a solution to control the virus and save lives. In this study, I aim to predict the efficiency of COVID-19 vaccinates around the world.

# Theme

I will use Data Classification and Clustering to analyze the efficiency of COVID-19 vaccines over the population infected and deaths reported.
